# Tokamak-zk-EVM/backend

## What are the backend algorithms
You can convert your Ethereum transactions into zero-knowledge proofs (zkp) even if you don't know zkp.

The three algorithms, "setup", "prove", and "verify", are rust implementation of the backend algorithms defined in [the Tokamak zk-SNARK manuscript](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/507).
They take a zkp circuit specialized for a transaction as their input. The circuit should be pre-processed by [the frontend compilers](../frontend/).
More specifically,
- setup/trusted-setup: it takes a library of subcircuits generated by [the QAP-compiler](../frontend/qap-compiler/) as input and generates a reference string and commitments to the subcircuit library.
- prove: it takes the subcircuit library and the transaction-specific details generated by [the Synthesizer](../frontend/synthesizer) as input and generates a zk proof.
- verify: it takes public inputs, the setup outputs, and the zk proof as input and accept or reject the proof.

## How to use?
### Prerequisite
- Install Node.js – https://nodejs.org/
- Install Circom – https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/
- Install Rust – https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- Install CMake – https://cmake.org/download/
- Make sure that you have run [Synthesizer](../frontend/synthesizer/README.md).
### Build the backend packages
- Make sure you are in `Tokamak-zk-EVM/packages/backend`.
- Run one of the follows depending on your OS
    - MacOS
        ```bash
        #MacOS
        ./mac-packaging.sh
        ```
    - Ubuntu22
        ```bash
        #Ubuntu22
        ./linux22-packaging.sh
        ```
    - Ubuntu20
        ```bash
        #Ubuntu20
        ./linux20-packaging.sh
        ```
### Run the backend
- Change the directory to either `./dist-linux20`, `./dist-linux22`, or `./dist-mac`, dpending on your OS.
- Run the follows:
    ```Bash
    # Run the setup
    ./1_run-trusted-setup.sh

    # Run the preprocess for verify
    ./2_run-preprocess.sh

    # Run the prove
    ./3_run-prove.sh

    # Run the verify
    ./4_run-verify.sh
    ```
### (Optional) Run the backend in a debugging mode with CodeLLDB
- Make sure that [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb) is installed on your VS Code as an extension.
- Go to the `Run and Debug` menu on the left side of your VS Code.
- Open the dropdown box at the top and select the algorithm you want to debug.
- Click the `Start Debugging (F5)` button.

## Description for the Setup input and output
### Input
The setup (both trusted- and MPC-setups) requires the only input from the QAP-compiler, which is [a library of subcircuits](../frontend/qap-compiler/subcircuits/library). This input would be more likely fixed. It will be changed whenever there is a change in the EVM's spec.
### Output
You can find the only setup output from [the "output" folder](./setup/trusted-setup/output), named "combined_sigma.json", which is denoted and defined as $\mathbb{\sigma}$ in the manuscript. The output would rarely change, as it depends on the EVM sepc.

## Description for the Prove input and output
### Input
The prove takes its input from the following three paths:
- The setup outputs,
- [A library of subcircuits](../frontend/qap-compiler/subcircuits/library) generated by the QAP-compiler, and
- transaction-specific details such as the subcircuits combination, wire map, instances, and witnesses analyzed by the Synthesizer.
### Output
- Zk proof of correct execution of a transaction

## Description for the Verify input and output
### Input
The verify takes its input from the following three paths:
- The setup outputs,
- The zk proof, and
- [Public inputs](../frontend/synthesizer/examples/outputs/publicInstance.json) provided by the Synthesizer.
### Output
- It will display a message "true", if the zk proof is verified.
