# How to Participate in the Tokamak ZKP Airdrop

This guide explains how to participate in the [Tokamak ZKP airdrop](https://zkp.tokamak.network) **without** using the playground app. If you prefer not to rely on the app, we encourage you to review the code, build it yourself, and generate the proof with the binary you built.

## Steps

1. **Clone the Tokamak‑zk‑EVM repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tokamak-network/Tokamak-zk-EVM.git
   cd tokamak-zk-evm
   ```

2. **Review the main script**  
   Read the [`tokamak-cli`](../tokamak-cli) script in the project root.

3. **Follow the Getting Started guide**  
   See the “Getting Started” section in the project [README](../README.md).

4. **Submit your proof**  
   Find the `tokamak-zk-evm-proof.zip` file in the proof directory you set in step 3, and submit it via this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/BocX6o4GZRcmr3fF7).
